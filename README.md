AssetScooper is a smart contract designed to streamline **batch swaps** on Uniswap V3, leveraging **Permit2** for gas-efficient token approvals. It enables users to swap multiple tokens into a single output token in a single transaction, making it ideal for portfolio consolidation, liquidity provision, and arbitrage strategies.

---

## Features

- **Batch Swaps**: Swap multiple tokens into a single output token in one transaction.
- **Permit2 Integration**: Eliminate the need for multiple token approvals with off-chain signatures.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Reduce gas costs by bundling swaps into a single multicall.
- **Protocol Fees**: A small fee is deducted to sustain the protocol.
- **Security**: Built with reentrancy protection, deadline enforcement, and pausable functionality.

## How It Works

AssetScooper simplifies the process of swapping multiple tokens by combining the power of **Uniswap V3**, **Permit2**, and **multicall**. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **User Initiates Swap**: The user specifies the input tokens, output token, minimum amounts, and a deadline.
2. **Permit2 Signature**: The user signs a Permit2 permit, granting AssetScooper permission to transfer their tokens.
3. **Token Transfer**: AssetScooper transfers the tokens from the userâ€™s wallet using Permit2.
4. **Batch Swap Execution**: AssetScooper constructs a multicall payload and executes the swaps on Uniswap V3.
5. **Fee Deduction & Output Transfer**: A protocol fee is deducted, and the remaining output tokens are sent to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Hardhat or Foundry (for local testing)
- Ethers.js or Web3.js (for interaction)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/asset-scooper.git
   cd asset-scooper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Compile the contract:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

### Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything works as expected:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

---

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1. Set up your `.env` file with the following variables:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
INFURA_API_KEY=your-infura-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-key
```

2. Deploy the contract to your desired network:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
```

### Interacting with AssetScooper

1. **Initialize a Swap**:
Prepare the swap parameters, including the input tokens, output token, minimum amounts, and deadline.
2. **Sign the Permit2 Permit**:
Use a wallet or SDK to sign the Permit2 permit.
3. **Execute the Swap**:
Call the `sweepAsset` function on the AssetScooper contract with the signed permit and swap parameters.
Example:

```solidity
IAssetScooper.SwapParam memory param = IAssetScooper.SwapParam({
    assets: [token1, token2],
    tokenOut: USDC,
    minOutputAmounts: [minAmount1, minAmount2],
    deadline: block.timestamp + 3600
});

ISignatureTransfer.PermitBatchTransferFrom memory permit = ISignatureTransfer.PermitBatchTransferFrom({
    permitted: [
        ISignatureTransfer.TokenPermissions({ token: token1, amount: amount1 }),
        ISignatureTransfer.TokenPermissions({ token: token2, amount: amount2 })
    ],
    nonce: nonce,
    deadline: block.timestamp + 3600
});

bytes memory signature = signPermit2Permit(permit, userPrivateKey);

assetScooper.sweepAsset(param, permit, signature, userAddress);
```

---

## Protocol Fees

AssetScooper deducts a small protocol fee from the output tokens. The fee is calculated as:

```bash
Protocol Fee = (Output Balance * PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS) / 10,000
```

The fee is sent to the `protocolFeeRecipient` address specified during deployment.

---

## Security

AssetScooper is built with security in mind:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **Deadline Enforcement**: Ensures swaps are executed within a specified time frame.
- **Pausable**: The contract owner can pause the contract in case of emergencies.
